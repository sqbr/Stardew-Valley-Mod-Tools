A mod to replace critters with various weird creatures, such as bats, fairies, dragons, and flying eyeballs. Critters are the little animals in the background: birds, rabbits, squirrels, butterflies etc. I didn't change the parrots that show up in the valley, any farm animals, or Rusty the dog. 

Not compatible with version 1.4 or below. I am pretty sure it would work in other languages.  

There's toggles to turn on and off weird creatures in the Valley, Desert and Ginger Island. But I didn't change the Ginger Island ones much asides from the butterflies becoming fairies. 

Pairs well with my Cuter Mines. You could also add even more critters with any of the

Credits and Permissions:
I've used some creative commons sprite resources, as listed in the credits. Asides from the specific licenses associated with those files, people are welcome to modify and re-use this mod as long you give me and the other artists credit. 

Known Issues:
I haven't figured out how to test the bird animations during the Perfection cutscene so  if you manage to see them, let me know if they work >.>

Conflicts:
This only edits the parts of images to do with critters, so will conflict with critter editing mods but shouldn't affect any other sort of mods.
