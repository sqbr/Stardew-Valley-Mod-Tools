Blue and Purple User Interface (Content Patcher)

A blue and purple user interface. Compatible with all the translations, as far as I can tell, but let me know if you hit any issues. Probably not android compatible, sorry. 

It shouldn't interfere with any mods that aren't also modifying the UI. 

I couldn't find any easy way to change the brown text shadow, but spirit's  [Stardew Valley] Font property mode https://m.blog.naver.com/khs3400/222049471897 will remove some of it. The following config file for that mod will also make the money colour prettier:

{
  "Debug": false,
  "HideShadow": true,
  "EnableFixSmallFontLineSpace": false,
  "SmallFontLineSpace": 30,
  "EnableFixFontPixelZoom": false,
  "FontPixelZoom": 1.0,
  "EnableFixFontColor": false,
  "FontColor": [],
  "EnableFixImgColor": true,
  "ImgColor": [
    {
      "Name": "Money",
      "Target": [
        128,
        0,
        0,
        255
      ],
      "Change": [
        0,
        0,
        128,
        255
      ]
    }
  ]
}
